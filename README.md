# dotfiles
Configuration files for Linux, especially ArchLinux, that I personally use.

# ArchLinux

## Pacman hooks

- remove_old_cache.hook
- update_elasticsearch_plugins.hook
- update_mirrorlist.hook

# Games

## Portal 2

Put `autoexec.cfg` in `<Path/to/SteamLibrary>/steamapps/common/Portal 2/portal2/bin/cfg` to enable:

- Easy access to the developer console on Nordic keyboard (since the default `~` is hard to access) with `F11`.
- Key-bindings for starting a local co-op game using keyboard and one gamepad.
    - Press `F9` to start local co-op game.
    - When started, press `F10` to toggle keyboard to Player 2.
